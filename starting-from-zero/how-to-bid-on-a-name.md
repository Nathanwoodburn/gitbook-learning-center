# 如何获得域名

## Name search

Visit [https://www.namebase.io/domains](https://www.namebase.io/domains) and use the Power search to find names you want to [own](../about-handshake/about-handshake/unstoppable-and-private.md).

There are 4 possible results to the search:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Text" %}
1. The auction is over, visit Namebase [marketplace](broken-reference) to buy your name.
2. The auction hasn't started and placing a bid on this—around 30 minutes to confirm—will begin the auction. The auction lasts 720 [blocks](../about-handshake/blockchain-refresher.md#block-time) , and the winner will pay the [second-highest bid ](../about-handshake/handshake-auction.md)to receive their Handshake name at the end of the 1440 blocks reveal period; roughly 15 days from when the first bid was placed.&#x20;
3. The auction is underway. The winner will pay the second-highest bid to receive their Handshake name at the end of the 1440 blocks reveal period.
4. The name hasn't been [released](../about-handshake/about-handshake/#endless-top-level-domains) yet. Add it to your watchlist to receive an email when the name is released.
{% endtab %}

## Blinds and lockups

Lockup Amount = Bid Amount + Added Blind

Adding blinds can be useful during auctions for hiding the true value of your bid from others since you only have to have the highest Bid Amount to win an auction. Note the amount you place for your bid is called a "lockup" because you won't get to spend your Lockup Amount until the auction ends.
