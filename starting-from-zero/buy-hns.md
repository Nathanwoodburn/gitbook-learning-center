## Buy HNS with BTC

Anyone can purchase HNS with BTC on Namebase, but you will have to first purchase Bitcoin on another platform to then transfer to your Namebase account. _While there are numerous ways to purchase BTC, we show you 2 methods below — using Coinbase and Cash App._

{% hint style="info" %}
The price your purchase settles at may be different than the current price because we confirm BTC transactions after 3 [blocks ](../about-handshake/about-handshake.md#block-time)(\~30 minutes). Additionally, large order sizes may incur [price slippage](../about-namebase/revenue-streams.md#exchange) that affects the final overall settlement price, depending on the liquidity available on the market. Check your [dashboard](https://www.namebase.io/dashboard) periodically to confirm your HNS reception.
{% endhint %}

### Coinbase

If you haven’t already, first set up your [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) account. Once you’re set up, visit [https://www.coinbase.com/price/bitcoin](https://www.coinbase.com/price/bitcoin) and buy however much Bitcoin you want to transfer to Namebase to convert into HNS. In your Coinbase Portfolio, select Bitcoin and its "Receive" tab, and then copy the receiving address of your Coinbase wallet.&#x20;

Go to [https://www.namebase.io/buy](https://www.namebase.io/buy) and enter roughly the amount of BTC you want to convert to HNS in the Step 1 section, paste the Coinbase receiving address in the Step 2 section, and then copy the address produced in Step 4 — this is your Namebase account’s receiving address where you will send the BTC in your Coinbase account to. Go back to Bitcoin in your Coinbase Portfolio and this time select the "Send" tab to paste your Namebase account’s receiving address into the “Recipient” field.
