# 如何购买HNS

{% hint style="info" %}
You will need a Namebase account to purchase HNS through Namebase.io. If you have not done so, please register [here](https://www.namebase.io/register).
{% endhint %}

## Buy HNS with BTC

If you are outside the USA and want to purchase HNS on Namebase, you will have to first purchase Bitcoin to then transfer to your Namebase account. _While there are numerous ways to buy BTC, the example below uses coinbase.com._

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Text" %}
1. If you haven’t already, first set up your Coinbase account. Once you’re set up, visit [https://www.coinbase.com/price/bitcoin](https://www.coinbase.com/price/bitcoin) and buy however much Bitcoin you want to transfer to Namebase to convert into HNS_._
2. In your Coinbase [Portfolio](https://www.coinbase.com/accounts), select Bitcoin and the Receive button, and copy the receiving address of your Coinbase wallet.
3. Go to [https://www.namebase.io/buy](https://www.namebase.io/buy) and enter the amount of BTC you want to convert to HNS in the Step 1 section, and paste the Coinbase receiving address in the Step 2 section.
4. Copy the address produced in Step 4—this is your Namebase account’s receiving address where you will send the BTC in your Coinbase account to.
5. Go back to Bitcoin in your Coinbase Portfolio and this time select the Send button, and paste your Namebase account’s receiving address into the “Recipient” field.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The price your purchase settles at may be different than the current price because we confirm BTC transactions after 6 blocks (\~1 hour). Additionally, large order sizes may incur price slippage that affects the final overall settlement price, depending on the liquidity available on the market. Check your [dashboard](https://www.namebase.io/dashboard) periodically to confirm your HNS reception.

## Buy HNS with USD

If you are a US citizen or person, the easiest way to purchase HNS will be directly with USD on Namebase, though you still have the option to purchase HNS with BTC.&#x20;
