# Use Handshake names

You [truly own](../about-handshake/about-handshake.md#true-domain-ownership) your Handshake names, which means you're free to do anything you'd like with them. Below are some of the ways you can use your Handshake names through Namebase.

{% hint style="success" %}
Share your resolvable Handshake name in the [Namer Community ](https://discord.gg/V3aTrkp)to become a Namer!
{% endhint %}

## Create a website

One of the most straightforward use cases of Handshake names is to set up a website on them. Check out the [Create Handshake websites](how-to-create-a-handshake-website.md) page for numerous tutorials on how on you can do so!

## Create a dLink

[dLinks](https://namebase.io/dlinks) enables you to create a fully decentralized website that's hosted on the decentralized Skynet storage network discoverable through your decentralized Handshake name without any coding. Check our dLink out at [nb/](https://hns.to/nb/)!

## Handshake login

### Identity manager

You can get to your identity manager by clicking "Log in with Handshake" on Namer News or by visiting [id.namebase.io](https://id.namebase.io) in your browser. Note that [id.namebase.io](http://id.namebase.io/) is just a static website that we've open sourced at [https://github.com/namebasehq/handshake-id-manager](https://github.com/namebasehq/handshake-id-manager), so you can host your own identity manager too instead of using the one at [id.namebase.io](http://id.namebase.io/).

### Namer News

Handshake login is used to log into [Namer News](http://news.namebase.io/). Click the "Log in with Handshake" button to and enter a Handshake name you own, and click "Continue".

Click "Continue to Namebase" to automatically set your authentication records. You can also click "Select a different identity" to log in with another Handshake name.

Once you've confirmed the records, you'll be redirected to Namer News and will be logged in as your Handshake name!

#### Logging in as a subdomain on a TLD you don't own

You can log in as a subdomain on someone else's Handshake name. For example, each Namebase team member logs into Namer News with their .namebase/ subdomain without actually owning the namebase/ TLD.&#x20;

You can do this too by first entering the Handshake name you'd like to log in with and clicking "Continue".

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-03-24 at 12.14.13.png>)

Click "Continue to Namebase" and copy the URL before you get redirected. Share this URL with the TLD owner.

Once they've opened the URL and automatically set the subdomain authentication records, you'll be able to log in with the subdomain.

## Redirect your name

[Redirects](https://www.namebase.io/manage/redirects) allows you to redirect your Handshake name to any other domain, serving as a human-readable URL shortener (e.g. [api.nb/](https://hns.to/api.nb/) [community.nb/](https://hns.to/community.nb/)). Hover over "Products" in the navbar and select "Redirects", then enter your redirects as follows:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember to include the "http://" or "https://" part of your redirect URL.
{% endhint %}

## Sell your name

Find your Handshake name in the [Domain Manager](https://www.namebase.io/domain-manager), select "Manage", and click the slider next to "Sell this domain" to set your name's "Buy now price" and list it for sale.&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Sell Name.gif>)

You can edit your listings' Buy now prices or remove them altogether in your Domain Manager's [for sale](https://www.namebase.io/for-sale) page.

## Gift your name

Find your Handshake name in the [Domain Manager](https://www.namebase.io/domain-manager), select "Manage", and select "Gift this domain". Make sure the email address of your recipient is the same as their Namebase account's. If the recipient doesn’t have a Namebase account, they’ll be prompted to create one when they claim their name.

If the recipient doesn't claim their name by the expiration date, the name will be returned to your account.

## Sell subdomains

The [Namebase Registry](../about-namebase/revenue-streams.md#namebase-registry) is a service that enables you to sell subdomains on your Handshake TLD. [Click here](https://www.namebase.io/registry/) to start selling now.
