# Buy Wrapped HNS (WHNS)

This tutorial assumes you already have a crypto wallet like Metamask installed and have transferred ETH or USDC into your wallet. If you have not done so, go to [Metamask.io](https://metamask.io) to set up your wallet, then transfer ETH to your wallet from Coinbase before continuing.

### Step 1: Head to Uniswap

Go to this link to get to the swap page for WHNS on Uniswap: [https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH\&outputCurrency=0xa771b49064da011df051052848477f18dba1d2ac](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH\&outputCurrency=0xa771b49064da011df051052848477f18dba1d2ac)

Since WHNS is a new token, you'll be prompted to import the token to your local token list. Click the Import button to continue.
