## Transfer in HNS

### From BTC

Use [this](../starting-from-zero/buy-hns.md#buy-hns-with-btc) guide to transfer BTC to your Namebase wallet to convert to HNS

### From another HNS wallet&#x20;

You can transfer HNS from another wallet directly to your [Namebase wallet](broken-reference) using the address on your [dashboard](https://www.namebase.io/dashboard). Due to the current volatility in Handshake's hash rate, Namebase confirms HNS deposits after 20 blocks, which typically takes 3-4 hours. Namebase will decrease the number of blocks needed to confirm deposits as the hash rate increases and stabilizes.
