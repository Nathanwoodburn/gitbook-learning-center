# Namebase Pro

## Trading fees

You'll notice that Namebase Pro has some of the lowest trading fees (0 bip maker fee 10 bip take fee) and we will continue to lower the fees over time (i.e. -5 bip maker fee) as well as making Namebase Pro more powerful, and introducing new features.

While you may see other exchanges list HNS, we are the only platform committed to unlocking Handshake's potential. We are here to enable an internet that is owned by individuals and not a handful of organizations like ICANN that control the DNS today.
