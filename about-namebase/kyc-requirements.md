# Modalités du KYC

Before you can start to buy HNS, you must first verify your profile. This process only takes a few minutes. Once you’ve answered a few basic questions and verified your contact details, you’ll be able to get HNS and start bidding in no time.

The verification process can vary depending on your location. Some users may only need to verify with their first name, last name, and phone number. For others it may require more information such as your ID (drivers license, local ID or passport). We partner with Jumio to verify accounts and store verification data. Jumio is also the verification partner that Coinbase, Airbnb, United Airlines, and many other well-known companies use. This is to ensure your data is always safe and secure.

Due to regulatory reasons (we're not happy about it either), Namebase accounts are restricted in functionality based on verification status. Before you verify your account, you can:

* Transfer HNS into your cloud wallet
* [Bid on Handshake TLDs](../starting-from-zero/how-to-bid-on-a-name.md)
* Withdraw Handshake TLDs

After you verify your account, you can:

* [Buy and Sell HNS with BTC](../starting-from-zero/buy-hns.md) (global)
* [Buy and Sell HNS with USD](../starting-from-zero/buy-hns.md) (US only)
* Trade on [Namebase Pro](namebase-pro.md) (only available outside the US)
* Withdraw HNS (only available outside the US)
