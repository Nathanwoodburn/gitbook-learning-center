# Community

Handshake is an entirely community-run movement. We believe that every individual on the Internet should [truly own their name](about-handshake.md#true-name-ownership) and as a Handshake community member, you too can immediately get involved and call yourself a [Director of Handshake](https://handshake.org/community/).&#x20;

## Namer Stories

[Namer Stories](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1478506) is a podcast series created by Namer [graham/](https://graham.hns.to), in which he interviews various members of the Handshake community to help give a better understanding of who we are and why we care. If you'd like to be a guest on his podcast, message him in the [Namer Community](https://community.namebase.io)!

## Handshake project sponsors and pledges

The Handshake project recognizes the work of the Free and Open Source Software community that’s helped get the internet to where it is today. To thank them for their efforts, [the Handshake project raised $10.2MM USD from project sponsors and distributed it in its entirely to the FOSS community](https://handshake.org/grant-sponsors/).&#x20;

* Pledge recipients include Apache Software Foundation, Internet Archive, OpenSSL project, FSF, GNOME, and many others&#x20;
* Project sponsors include a16z, Sequoia Capital, Greylock, IDEO Colab, Founders Fund, SV Angel, and dozens of others

For Handshake to be successful, it will take a global community effort that recognizes the work of the past and builds upon it into the future.

## Help drive Handshake adoption

Handshake won't work everywhere until DNS providers resolve its domains and browsers trust it as a root certificate. Handshake is controlled by no one but can be enhanced by anyone — everyone is a [Director of Handshake](https://handshake.org/community/) — and a strong engaged community of open-internet citizens is necessary to build momentum for wide adoption of Handshake.
